Hi there! 👋

My name is Lev, I'm a self-taught software developer from Russia. I'll be starting my first job in one week and I am excited to be exposed to many new things. That's why I decided to document my learnings in a TIL (Today I Learned) format about.

Stay tuned for more updates, see you soon!
